          Giraffes are animals native to Africa that generally live in the savannah. Giraffes are the tallest animal in the world, allowing them to eat leaves from tall trees. They typically do not drink a lot of water, as most of their water comes from the food they eat. Giraffes are also very unique and have different patches on their skin that help people identify them. Just like people have unique fingerprints, the giraffe's patches are unique to that certain giraffe.

          Lions are a species of big cat that are found in Africa and southwest India. Lions usually live in a group called a pride that consists of female lions, their cubs, and a small group of male lions to defend their territories. Lions are able to adapt to their environments, live in dry lands and get some of their water from plants and from the animals they hunt. Lions are very important and there needs to be actions taken to prevent their population from continuing to decline.

Many monkeys live in the rainforest and travel between branches in the rainforest's canopy. Monkeys travel in groups called troops and communicate with each other by using body movements, vocalization, and facial expressions.
